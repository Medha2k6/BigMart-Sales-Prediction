# BigMart-Sales-Prediction

Objective:-
Developed a predictive model to forecast sales for BigMartâ€™s 1559 products across 10 stores, aiming to optimize inventory management and sales strategies.

Project Overview:-
This project involves building a predictive model to estimate the sales of various products at different stores. The dataset includes sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores, along with several attributes of each product and store.

Data Processing:-
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized data distributions and relationships between features.
Identified key features impacting sales, such as product visibility, MRP, and store type.

Modeling:-
Implemented and evaluated multiple regression models, including:
  Random Forest
  Gradient Boosting
  XGBoost
  LightGBM
Achieved high accuracy and low error rates, improving sales prediction accuracy significantly.

Technologies Used:-
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Results:-
The final model provided accurate sales predictions, which can be used to optimize inventory management and enhance strategic marketing decisions.
